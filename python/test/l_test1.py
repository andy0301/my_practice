# Write a program which prints out all numbers between 1 and 100. When the program would print out a number exactly divisible by 4, 
# print "Linked" instead. When it would print out a number exactly divisible by 6, print "In" instead. 
# When it would print out a number exactly divisible by both 4 and 6, print "LinkedIn" instead.

# NOTE: my original solution used range(100) which starts at zero
# which isn't really what the question asked.
# The other thing to clarify is whether "between" is inclusive or not
# I assumed it was inclusive and let the interviewer know that
